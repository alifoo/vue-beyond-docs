# Vue Beyond Docs

The reason this repo is called "Vue Beyond Docs" it's because I believe the only way of really learning something is to create projects. Of course reading the documentation is important, however, what will happen if there's no documentation?

You can spend hours in the same problem, but after you solved once, it becomes easy to identify and never fall for the same mistake again.

This occurrence is a result of dedication and PURE EXECUTION. Only practice can make someone learn effectively.

This repository is a collection of projects specifically made with Vue (2 and 3) I made following tutorials or documentation. Of course, projects listed here are completely open, made for learning, can be entirely copied by anyone since most of them are not completely "original" too.

With this repository, my goal is to document my learning process with Vue and the projects I made along the way, what concepts I fortified with each one, etc.
