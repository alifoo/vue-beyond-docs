# Welcome to Vue Beyond Docs

This repository is meant to store every step of my learning of Vue. After finishing all relevant courses from VueSchool, I will modify this repository to store explanations and resources that are more suitable for beginner developers like me, with easy to understand examples.

After structuring the repo like this, I will start to add tricks that I find that sometimes are not so explicit within the Vue Docs, and that's why this is the name of the repo.
